# FWM

Implementation and evaluation of two parallel computational models for the simulation of a Long-haul DWDM System Limited by FWM

<p>-SequentialCPU.cpp->a sequential model<br>
-ParallelCPU.cpp-> a parallelization model considering a multicore processor using Open MultiProcessing (OpenMP)<br>
-ParallelGPU.cu ->a parallelization model using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) with Dynamic parallelism </p>
