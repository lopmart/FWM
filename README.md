# FWM

Implementation and evaluation of two parallel computational models for the simulation of a Long-haul DWDM System Limited by FWM

-SequentialCPU.cpp->a sequential model
-ParallelCPU.cpp-> a parallelization model considering a multicore processor using Open MultiProcessing (OpenMP)
-ParallelGPU.cu ->a parallelization model using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) with Dynamic parallelism
